# AirCanvas

AirCanvas is a fun project that allows you to create art in the air by simply waving your hands. This project utilizes OpenCV and Python, along with the hand tracking module (MediaPipe), to turn your hand movements into virtual paintings.

## Introduction

Traditional artists use physical canvases for their creations, but with AirCanvas, we take a step into the digital realm of art. By tracking your hand movements, you can draw and paint in the air, and your art will come to life on the screen.
